# Build an AI Agent for Your Storefront

This is a template Shopify app that interacts with a store in real time. It provides an AI-powered chat interface to help customers find products, answer questions about your shop, and complete purchases through natural conversation. The app uses Shopifyâ€™s Model Context Protocol endpoints for accurate, actionable responses. Learn more about MCP at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

## MCP Capabilities

- **Product Discovery**: Natural-language search and personalized recommendations
- **Store Information**: Answer questions about policies, shipping, returns, FAQs
- **Cart Management**: Create carts, add/remove items, and complete checkout seamlessly
- **Order Management**: Track order status and process returns

## Features of this template app
- **AI-Powered Chat**: Embedded chat bubble for real-time AI-powered shopping assistance (customize the prompt and/or change the LLM used, we use Claude for this template, for your needs)
- **MCP Cliente**: The app is also an MCP client that is already aware of Shopify's MCP tools (add more MCP servers if you need it)
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context throughout customer interactions
- **Custom Chat UI**: Shopify theme extension for seamless store integration (modify the app look and feel for your store)
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time message streaming for natural conversation flow


## Prerequisites
1. **Code Editor**: Install and use your favorite editor (e.g., [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/en/downloads), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)) for opening and editing project files.
2. **Node.js**: v18.20 or higher. Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
3. **Shopify Partner Account**: Sign up at [shopify.com/partners](https://www.shopify.com/partners)
4. **Shopify Development Store**: For testing and development. Follow [these nstructions](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/development-stores) to create one. Make sure to select the option to add products to your store.
5. **Anthropic API Key**: Go to the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/), generate a key, and store it securely. This template app uses Anthropic, but if you want to use another LLM, you can, and you'll need to modify the code.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Shopify/shop-chat-agent.git
   cd shop-chat-agent
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file with the following:
     ```
     CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
     ```

### Development

Start the development server:

```shell
shopify app dev --reset
```

1. Say yes, create it as a new app
2. Hit enter to accept the default name - all references are to this name, it should be `shop-chat-agent`
3. Choose a development store - MUST be a development store
4. Add password - Copy the URL in Terminal to get the direct link to access your store's password
5. End state is you will have a Preview URL... at this point we need to make a few more code changes


### Update shopify.app.toml

Add below content to your shopify.app.toml file:

```bash
[app_proxy]
url = "https://example.trycloudflare.com"
subpath = "chat"
prefix = "apps"
```

### Restart you dev server

```shell
shopify app dev
```

### Select yes to automatically update you app url's

```shell
Have Shopify automatically update your app's URL in order to create a preview experience?

> Yes, automatically update
```

### Install The App

Head to the url provided in your shell to install the app on your demo store

### Enable Chat Extension

Enable the chat extension from theme editor (Online store > Themes > Customize > App embeds)

## Add a explicit set of steps on how to do this

## Chat Interface

The chat bubble extension is located in `extensions/chat-bubble/`. It connects to the `/chat` endpoint of the app server to stream messages.

## MCP Tools Integration

The app integrates with Model Control Plane (MCP) tools, which allows the AI to access additional functionality. These tools are initialized in the `app/mcp-client.js` file.

## Examples
- hi, should return a LLM based response
- can you search for snowboards. This should do a shop specific search via MCP
- add <product name> to cart. This should execute the cart MCP and offer to checkout URL
- <Sid will come up with ways to test CA tools>

## Deployment

Follow standard Shopify app deployment procedures as outlined in the [Shopify documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web).

## Architecture

This app consists of two main components:

1. **Backend API**: A Remix app server that handles communication with Claude and processes chat messages
2. **Chat Bubble UI**: A Shopify theme extension that provides the customer-facing chat interface

This will:
- Start Remix in development mode
- Tunnel the local server to make it accessible by Shopify
- Provide a URL to install the app on your development store

### API Endpoints

- `/chat`: Main endpoint for streaming chat messages, supports both GET and POST requests


## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Remix](https://remix.run/)
- **AI**: [Claude by Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/claude)
- **Shopify Integration**: [@shopify/shopify-app-remix](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/shopify-app-remix)
- **Database**: SQLite (via Prisma) for session storage
