# Build an AI Agent for Your Storefront

This is a template Shopify app that interacts with a store in real time. It provides an AI-powered chat interface to help customers find products, answer questions about your shop, and complete purchases through natural conversation. The app uses Shopifyâ€™s Model Context Protocol endpoints for accurate, actionable responses. Learn more about MCP at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

## MCP Capabilities

- **Cart Management**: Create carts, add/remove items, and complete checkout seamlessly
- **Order Management**: Track order status and process returns

## Features of this template app
- **AI-Powered Chat**: Embedded chat bubble for real-time AI-powered shopping assistance (customize the prompt and/or change the LLM used, we use Claude for this template, for your needs)
- **MCP Cliente**: The app is also an MCP client that is already aware of Shopify's MCP tools (add more MCP servers if you need it)
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context throughout customer interactions
- **Custom Chat UI**: Shopify theme extension for seamless store integration (modify the app look and feel for your store)
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time message streaming for natural conversation flow

## Chat Interface

The chat bubble extension is located in `extensions/chat-bubble/`. It connects to the `/chat` endpoint of the app server to stream messages.
